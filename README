This project is to create a set of B&K libraries that can be called from python wrappers. 

Currently we build the library to and provide an example python usage.  

More complete python classes are TBD. 

Started working on this on 10=APR=2012

INSTALL

Edit the Makefile and change the value of 'prefix' to indicate where you want to install your library.


make 
make install

Have a look around to find the example script that calls these libraries inside python.
