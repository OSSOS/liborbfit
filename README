This project is to create a set of B&K libraries that can be called from python wrappers. 

Currently we build the library to and provide an example python usage.

Started working on this on 10=APR=2012

INSTALL

Edit the Makefile and change the value of 'prefix' to indicate where you want to install your library.


make 
make install


In the python directory there are a couple of module files you might find useful.

PYTHON USAGE:

orbfit_pyephem.py uses the orbfit library you just built and the 'pyephem' module  to run bk_orbfit

orbfit_astropy.py uses the orbfit library you just built and the astropy modeul as well as the mpc.py and util.py files to run bk_orbfit

You can try them out like so:

> cd python
> python orbfit_pyepehem.py
> python orbfit_astropy.py

They provide slightly different JD conversions, but the end result is positions that agree at 0.001 arcseconds.

The main advantage in mpc.py is the use of a parser that understands a variety of formats the ephemeris measurements are sometimes reported in.
